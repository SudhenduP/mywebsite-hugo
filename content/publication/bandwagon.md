Modeling the interpersonal effect and bandwagon effect in collective gatekeeping with threshold models, we confirm the bandwagon effect of collective gatekeeping on news diffusion with two novel datasets. The results demonstrate that the bandwagon of collective gatekeepers is the primary driver for online news diffusion. Interestingly, the bandwagon effect of collective gatekeeping is moderated by the strength of interpersonal effects. The theoretical generalizations of this research contribute to our understanding about the impact of collective gatekeeping on information diffusion."

Jumping onto the Bandwagon of Collective Gatekeepers: Testing the Bandwagon Effect of Information Diffusion on Social News Website


## Highlights

1. Drawing on threshold models to capture the interpersonal effects and collective gatekeeping, we test our hypothesis with two novel datasets of information diffusion on social media.
2. The findings demonstrate that both bandwagon effect and interpersonal effect play important roles in collective gatekeeping on social media.
3. The bandwagon of collective gatekeepers is the primary driver for online news diffusion
4. The bandwagon effect of collective gatekeeping is moderated by the strength of interpersonal effects.
