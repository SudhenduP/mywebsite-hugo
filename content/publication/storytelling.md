abstract = "To capture	the	shape	of stories	is crucial	forunderstanding the	mind of	human	beings.	 In	this research,	we use	word	emdeddings	methods,	a	widely used	tool in	natural	 language	 processing	 and	 machine learning, in	order	to	quantify and compare emotional	arcs of stories over	time.	Based on trained	Google	News word2vec	vectors	and	film scripts corpora	(N =1109),	we form the	fundamental	 building	blocks of	story emotional	 trajectories. The results demonstrate that there exists only one universal pattern of story shapes in	movies.	Furthermore, there is a	positivity and	gender bias in story narratives.	More	interesting, the audience	reveals	a completely	different	preference from	content	producers."

The manuscript titled The Hidden Shape of Stories Reveals Positivity Bias and Gender Bias authored by Huimin Xu et al.  has already appeared on arxiv. Please check this link https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04599.pdf. So far, it still lacks theoretical underpinnings, and your comments are welcome.
