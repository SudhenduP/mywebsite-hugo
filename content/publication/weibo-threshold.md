abstract = "In light of both threshold models and the J-curve model of information diffusion, this present study reformulates the threshold hypothesis for interpersonal effects and tests it using a dataset of information diffusion on Sina Weibo. The findings confirm the threshold hypothesis of interpersonal effects. There is a J-curve relationship between interpersonal effects and diffusion size. Further, such curvilinear relationship is moderated by the depth of diffusion networks. Additionally, the depth of diffusion is relatively limited and the temporal diffusion curves are featured by strong bursts. In all, this research extends threshold models of interpersonal effects by linking it with the J-curve model, and further explicates it with the moderation effect of the depth of diffusion networks.
